.Divi child theme by Michael Habib.

== Notes:
- This is still in *Alpha* phase.
- HACK : All js files must be required in source/index.js in order for webpack to copy them to the correct output folder.
** Possible Fix: correctly use webpack to combine all js files.

== Features & Addons:

=== Added MagnificPopup JS Plugin.
- Added using cdnjs.com and using wp_enqueue() function in functions.php
- JS code in source/js/magnific-popup.custom.js

=== Added custom "tabs" jquery module.
- Needs refactoring & to be packaged as a proper module.
- JS code in source/js/custom.js #Custom Tabs Module
- CSS/SCSS code in source/scss/custom.scss #Custom Tabs Module

=== Added Swiper JS Plugin.
- Added using cdnjs.com and using wp_enqueue() function in functions.php

== Goals
